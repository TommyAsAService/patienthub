# Patient Hub
Patient Hub is a prototype application to illustrate what could be done to assist patients with their recovery following a heart attack or other serious medical event. Patient Hub not only helps patients adhere to their recovery plans but also enables more frequent updates back to the patient's medical team.

Patient Hub was created as part of the SOFTENG 702 (COMPSCI 705) course at the University of Auckland. More information about the course can be found [here](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci705s2c/). More information about the usage of the application can be found [here](https://youtu.be/i35-QYCiEps)

Created by Mark Aziz, John Burrows, Hoang (Tommy) Ngo and Elliot Varoy. Supervised by Jim Warren.
